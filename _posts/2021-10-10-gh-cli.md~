## GH-cli tool

`gh` is a tool that integrates most of github functionalities into the terminal, you can manage repos, issues and authintication tokens

## Quick start 

Windows : use chocolaty `choco install gh`

Linux :  https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md

### Auth 

use `gh auth login` to authinticate with your github account, follow instructions that will appear on terminal

## Setting an editor 
`gh config set editor <editor>`, I recommend vim cause you won't break the flow each time tou wanna commit by opening a graphical editor

## simple workflow

list repos for a specific user
`gh repo list hamzawinix`

clone a repo by user/repo
`gh repo clone hamzawinix/hamzawinix.github.io`

add newly created files to a repo 
`git add .`

commit all and write a long message
`git commit -a`

commit all and write a short one liner
`git commit -a -m "commit message"`

push local repo to source
`git push`
