## For people who are sick of the way modern web works

"AAAAAAAAAA I just want the simplest way to post some imagery and text for ma homies " 
if that sounds like you, and you dont need to deal with "medium" nonesense (likes based system, auth) then look no further than **txti.es** 


Minimalism at its finest.
