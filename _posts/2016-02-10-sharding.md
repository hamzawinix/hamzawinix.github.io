## For people who are sick of the way modern web works

If you have ever tried to publish some simple text and imagery you might came across sites like medium , medium is good for content creation but what if you want something simpler, not tied to your name or needs auth, just as simple as content can be you quickly find that medium is limiting and exhausting .

you might then consider building your own website, but you quickly find its more trouple than its worth for your simple blogging needs.

If you ever say :" I just want this paragraph out on the internet" then txti.es is for you, minimalism at its finest.
